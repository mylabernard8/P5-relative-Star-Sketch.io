# Reflection
### What was challenging for you during this process?
*The most challenging thing during this process was trying to get the coordinates for the star in the sketch because I first submitted my sketch and my coordinates were specific to one star with very restricting numbers. However, after meeting with the teacher and learning how to make the star more relative to the confines it si put in, I was able to calculate the correct points.

### What makes more sense now than it did before you started?
* Learning how to creat relative shapes makes much more sense then when I first started, also I think just learning how to create shapes in general and the information that is needed for the computer to produce them.

### What are you proud of?
* I am proud of the shape I was able to create and the calculations that made it possible.
